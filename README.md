# CSSGrid-dashboard

Admin dashboard interface created using an agregious amount of CSS Grid for practice. 

The only display value used in the entire layout is display grid, even when it compltely made sense to use Flexbox. CSS is transpiled from SCSS so I can utilise Sass variables, mixins and nesting.
